# GettingStarted_Buildroot
This is a repository to host a buildroot with my own application in order to playing around with buildroot and finding out how everything comes toghether.



# following releases are available so far (release assets are stored unter release tab in github)
- v1.0      -->     basecode of official buildroot code
- v1.0.8    -->     configured for qemu-arm. zImage can be run on qemu and linux boots correctly.
